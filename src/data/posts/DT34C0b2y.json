But, let’s face it, docs are sometimes too dense or lack examples or are incomplete (sorry but RTFM doesn’t always help). That is when we look for some beginner guides or youtube tutorials. Luckily the web is overflowing with such stuff — “How to get started with X in Y mins?”. And undoubtedly that does help us get going. But, wait for a second, does it end here? No, that would be too soon to raise “Mission Accomplished” Banner.",

But, we hold the choice over the type & quality of those problems. If we can increase the awareness and retention of solutions to simpler issues, we can increase the attention towards more difficult ones on Q&A platforms. That would lead to an overall increase in the quality of the products we deliver.\n\nGreat experiences are easier to remember. One would have higher retention of the awesome talk they listened to, a great article they read in the evening rather than getting over with a frustrating issue through a quick fix. It comes as no surprise that even the great Dan Abramov would tweet something like that :P\n\nStackCrunch has immense respect for the StackExchange communities & is built to show gratitude to the amazing work put forward by its developers, maintainers, & most importantly the Contributors.\nsomething",
